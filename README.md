# Random-Forest-Classifier
Random Forest Classifier is popular in the world of machine learning as an ensemble of the Decision tree. It is a supervised learning method that can be used for both classification or regression tasks. It provides a higher level of accuracy in predicting outcomes over the decision tree algorithm because the random forest combines several decision trees.
## The reasons random forest classifier is very well over the edge are:
 -	It reduces over fitting because they are built using an ensemble of decision trees.
 -	It can handle high dimensional data with many features because it considers only a random subset of each features to split.
 - It is robust to missing values and outliers in the dataset i.e., it is less sensitive to missing values and outliers because of the random subset of feature     selection.
 -	Provides feature importance in the sense that it measures and understands the relationship between features and target variables.
